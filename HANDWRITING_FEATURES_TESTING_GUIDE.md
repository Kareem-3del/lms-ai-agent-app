- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Settings persist after app restart

### PDF Generation
- [ ] Selected paper background appears
- [ ] Table background wraps paper correctly
- [ ] Margins are applied
- [ ] Font size is correct
- [ ] Line height looks natural
- [ ] Letter/word spacing is visible
- [ ] Effects are applied correctly

## üêõ Known Behaviors

1. **Effects only visible after generation** - This is by design. Effects are applied during PDF rendering.

2. **Mirror margins** - Only affects even-numbered pages in multi-page documents.

3. **Custom fonts** - Uploaded fonts are stored in `<downloadPath>/custom-fonts/` directory.

4. **Table background** - Creates a wrapper around the paper. Best viewed with effects enabled.

5. **Random rotations** - Applied subtly for natural look. May not be obvious on single letters.

## üéì Tips for Best Results

1. **Natural Look:** Use subtle rotations (0.3-0.8 degrees) for most realistic handwriting
2. **Lined Paper:** Increase line height to 2.0-2.5 for better alignment
3. **Grid Paper:** Use exact line height multiples (1.0, 1.5, 2.0)
4. **Margins:** Leave at least 20px on all sides for professional look
5. **Effects:** Enable 2-3 effects max to avoid over-processing
6. **Quality:** Use "Print Quality" only for final submissions (slower)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Settings not saving?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `settingsManager` is initialized
- Check file permissions on userData folder

### PDF looks wrong?
- Verify "Use handwriting style" is enabled
- Check that Gemini API key is configured
- Try regenerating with default settings first

### Custom font not appearing?
- Verify file is valid font format (.ttf, .otf, .woff, .woff2)
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Look in `<downloadPath>/custom-fonts/` directory

### Effects not visible?
- Remember: Effects only show AFTER PDF generation
- They won't appear in the preview/editor
- Generate a test PDF to verify

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Debug Console (Debug button in app)
2. Look for error messages in logs
3. Verify all settings are within valid ranges
4. Try with default settings first
5. Check GitHub issues or create a new one
