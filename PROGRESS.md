## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Electron 28
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Storage**: electron-store (encrypted)
- **Build Tool**: tsc (TypeScript compiler)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **AI Integration** - Integrate OpenAI or local LLM for assignment classification
2. **Document Editor** - Implement rich text editor with special features
3. **Authentication** - Add username/password login support
4. **Upload System** - Complete submission workflow

## 📝 Notes

- Download manager infrastructure is complete but needs integration with LMS clients
- UI follows system theme (light/dark mode)
- All file operations use sanitized names for security
- Settings are encrypted at rest
